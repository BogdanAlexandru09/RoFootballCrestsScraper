# RoFootballCrestsScraper

Main points:

- makes a request to the Transfermarkt page containing the first/second Romanian football division table;
- gets the crests of all football clubs;
- saves them in a local directory within your system.

You can use them for various tasks (maybe you want to add them inside a chart, some statistics etc).

If you need smaller/larger images of the crests, you can check the available options provided by the Transfermarkt CDN (I am looking for "normal" sized crests,
but there is also "tiny" or "head" which are smaller).
